### Introduction to API Hands-On Learning

Now that we've discussed the concept of an **API**—Application Programming Interface—it’s time to put what you’ve learned into practice. Instead of passively listening, you're going to start thinking about real-world examples of APIs and identifying the **A (Application)**, **P (Program)**, and **I (Interface)** components for each.

Let’s quickly review the meaning of each part of the API:
- **I** (Interface): The point or boundary where you request a program to run.
- **P** (Program): The task or process being executed.
- **A** (Application): The software or system that contains and maintains the program.

### Example 1: Viber Messaging on a Cell Phone

In this first example, consider using Viber to send a message through the app on your phone.

- **I (Interface)**: The Viber cell phone app serves as the interface. This is the point where you interact with the application and tell it to send a message.
- **P (Program)**: The task or program running is messaging. Viber’s program sends the message you’ve written.
- **A (Application)**: Viber is the application that maintains and runs the messaging program.

### Example 2: Google Search on a Computer

Next, let’s look at doing a **Google search** from your computer.

- **I (Interface)**: The interface is the Google search page accessed through a browser on your computer. This is where you type in your query.
- **P (Program)**: The program being run performs the internet search, retrieving relevant results.
- **A (Application)**: Google’s search engine is the application that handles and processes the search query.

### Example 3: Creating Orders in eBay Without a Browser (Moderate API)

Now we’re moving into more complex API examples. Imagine creating an **order in eBay** without using a browser.

- **I (Interface)**: The interface is not on your computer or phone this time. Instead, it’s an API provided by eBay itself. You access this interface over the network to create an order.
- **P (Program)**: The program creates an order for you in eBay’s system.
- **A (Application)**: eBay is the application that provides and maintains the program for order creation.

### Example 4: Creating Orders in SAP Without a Browser (Complex API)

For the final example, consider **creating orders in SAP** without a browser.

- **I (Interface)**: SAP provides an interface that allows external access to create an order, much like eBay.
- **P (Program)**: The program that handles the creation of an order is what’s running.
- **A (Application)**: SAP is the application that holds, maintains, and runs this program.

### Why Are Moderate and Complex APIs Useful?

1. **Efficiency and Cost Savings**: Companies, like eBay and SAP, provide APIs for others to use. By doing this, they don’t need to build and maintain interfaces for every possible use case. You just access their API and tell it what to do.
   
2. **Flexibility**: These APIs can be accessed through various methods—whether through Python, JavaScript, a web browser, or any other tool. The API doesn’t care about the method you use, as long as it gets the right instructions.

### What’s Next in This Course?

You will soon start working with more complex APIs, the kind used in real-world applications, beyond basic messaging or search functions. Here’s what you’ll be learning:
- **XML and JSON**: Two formats for data exchange.
- **REST and POST**: The protocols for interacting with APIs.
- **Python and Postman**: Tools to interact with and create APIs.

This course will go beyond just concepts and theory—you’ll actually be building, using, and interacting with APIs in practice!
