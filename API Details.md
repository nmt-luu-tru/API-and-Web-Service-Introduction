Let's break down what happens during every **API transaction**, focusing on the three key steps you mentioned:

1. **A request is made** for something to be done.
2. **A program is run** to complete that request.
3. **The program sends back a response** with the result.

These steps apply to every API interaction, whether it's a simple web search or a more complex order being placed via an API.

### Example 1: Google Search from a Computer

Let’s start with the **Google search example**:

- **Step 1: A request is made.**
   - You type the word "tuna" into the search box and press "Search." This action sends a request to Google’s servers (computers).
   - The request is actually an HTTP request, which gets sent to a **URL** (Uniform Resource Locator). In this case, the URL might look like:
     ```
     www.google.com/search?q=tuna
     ```
   - Here, the term "tuna" is passed as a **parameter** (`q=tuna`), telling the program to search for that word.

- **Step 2: The program runs.**
   - The search program is stored on a **Google computer** (server) at the `/search` location. The server then runs the search algorithm.
   - Google’s program fetches all relevant results for the search term "tuna."

- **Step 3: The program sends back a response.**
   - Google’s program returns a web page (in **HTML**) that displays the search results for "tuna."
   - The response is the web page you see, which contains links and information related to your search.

#### Summary of the Request and Response URL:
- **Request URL**: `www.google.com/search?q=tuna`
- **Response**: A web page with search results.

### Example 2: eBay Order API (More Complex)

Now, let’s explore the **eBay Order API**, which is more complicated because you interact directly with eBay’s servers, not through a user interface (like a web page) but through an API.

- **Step 1: A request is made.**
   - You want to create an order in eBay’s system, but instead of doing this via the website, you're using the **eBay API**.
   - The request is sent to a specific **endpoint** on eBay’s server, such as:
     ```
     www.apix.sandbox.ebay.com/buy/order
     ```
   - Here, the request includes additional information, such as the item to order, payment details, and shipping info, often in a format like **JSON** or **XML**. These details are packaged in the request body.
   
- **Step 2: The program runs.**
   - The API request goes to the eBay server, where the **order program** runs within the `/buy/order` folder.
   - eBay’s order processing system validates your order and processes it.

- **Step 3: The program sends back a response.**
   - eBay’s server sends a response confirming the order, including important details like the order number and status.
   - This response is typically sent back as **JSON** or **XML** data, which your system can then read and display.

#### Summary of the Request and Response:
- **Request URL**: `www.apix.sandbox.ebay.com/buy/order`
- **Request Body**: Contains order details like item ID, payment method, etc.
- **Response**: Confirmation of the order, such as `{"orderID": "12345", "status": "confirmed"}`.

### Key Takeaways
- **Requests**: In an API transaction, you send a request to a specific location (URL or endpoint) on a server. The request may include parameters or additional data, depending on what you need the program to do.
- **Programs**: The program that processes the request lives on the server and runs in response to the request. It's like telling a remote worker (the API) to do a job for you.
- **Responses**: The program sends back a response, which contains the result of the task. This response can be as simple as an HTML web page or as complex as a structured JSON data set.

As you progress through the course, you'll get more comfortable with how to build and send requests, handle responses, and use different API tools like **Postman** to test them. This knowledge will help you navigate both simple and complex APIs effectively, and you'll soon be running your own API calls like a pro!
