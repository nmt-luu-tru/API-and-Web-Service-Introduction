## Course Conclusion: Introduction to APIs and Web Services

Congratulations! You’ve now completed the first section of this course, where we explored the foundational concepts of APIs and web services.

### What is an API?

In this section, you learned that an API, or *Application Programming Interface*, is a set of rules and protocols that enable different software applications to communicate with each other. APIs are essential in software development as they allow applications to access and utilize the functionalities of other applications or services. By facilitating this interaction, APIs promote efficiency and integration between systems, which is critical for modern software architecture.

### What is a Web Service?

You also discovered that a web service is a specific type of API that operates over the internet. Web services use protocols like REST, SOAP, or XML-RPC and exchange data using formats like JSON or XML. Not all APIs are web services, but all web services are APIs. The key difference is that web services must use the web as their medium of communication, whereas other APIs can work within a single application without requiring the internet.
